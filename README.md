# work-day-schedule

## Functionality

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

Add important events to a daily planner to help manage my time effectively


## How does it work?

When you open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
and you can see timeblocks for standard business hours
Note, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

## Enter an event
 Click into a timeblock type an event and click the save button for that timeblock
 you will see the text for that event is saved in local storage.


The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
